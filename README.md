# Our_p3p
Codes (encrypted using MATLAB pcode()) and demos for our p3p method, the codes will be released after being acceptted.

# Thirdparty Methods (Folder "P3P_tool" )
The thirdparty p3p methods are from the p3p-toolbox provided by Gaku Nakano [link](https://github.com/g9nkn/p3p_problem). 

The folder is almost a copy of that toolbox, except for a few lines added by us in the Function "p3p_gao" to prevent NAN-error occured in real experiments
