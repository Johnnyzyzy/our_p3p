# our_p3p
Codes (encrypted using MATLAB pcode()) and demos for our p3p method, the raw codes will be released after being acceptted.

# thirdparty p3p methods (Folder "P3P_tool" )
The thirdparty p3p methods are from the p3p-toolbox provided by Gaku Nakano [link](https://github.com/g9nkn/p3p_problem) , which is an official MATLAB implementation of the paper "A Simple Direct Solution to the Perspective-Three-Point Problem", BMVC2019. 

The folder is almost a copy of that toolbox, except for a few lines added by us in the Function "p3p_gao" to prevent nan-error occured in real experiments
